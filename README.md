## 🚨 The Problem & Our Solution
In India, millions of citizens with physical or visual impairments struggle to navigate public buildings, educational campuses, and hospitals due to unmapped barriers like broken elevators, steep ramps, or blocked pathways. 

**AccessTwin** solves this by creating a real-time, interactive digital twin of any campus. We empower the community to crowdsource physical barriers, verify them using AI, and calculate customized obstacle-free paths. 

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🗺️ **Interactive Spatial Digital Twin (Dijkstra's Algorithm):** Interactive SVG-based floor maps that map nodes across the campus. The system uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest, safest, and 100% obstacle-free route specifically tailored for wheelchair users.
* 🗣️ **Voice-Guided Wayfinding & Detection:** Full integration with the Web Speech API (`window.speechSynthesis`). The system provides human-like turn-by-turn auditory instructions for navigation and announces AI-detected obstacles for visually impaired users.
* 📸 **TwinGram (Gamified Social Feed):** A community-driven feed where students and visitors upload photos of physical barriers. The community confirms these issues, building a trustable "Confidence Score".
* 🤖 **AI Vision Intelligence (Gemini AI):** Uses Google Gemini's advanced multimodal capabilities for deep contextual analysis, detecting architectural features (like ramps and stairs), and generating automated, cost-effective repair recommendations.
* 📈 **Campus Accessibility Benchmark Index:** Automatically calculates an overall accessibility score for each building based on structural features, crowdsourced verified reports, and automated sensor audits.
* 🛠️ **Admin Dashboard & SVG Ingestion:** Administrators can view reports, plan fixes, and upload new SVG floor maps directly into the digital twin ecosystem.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally (Single Terminal)

This project uses `concurrently` to run both the React frontend and the FastAPI backend side-by-side perfectly.

### 📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* **Node.js (v18 or higher)** - [Download Node.js Here](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Python 3.11.x** - [Download Python 3.11.9 Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujitnayak-web/AccessTwin.git
cd AccessTwin
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
cd navigation-backend

# Create and activate a Virtual Environment using Python 3.11
py -3.11 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

### 3. Setup AI Environment (Windows PowerShell)
Before running the app, set your Gemini API key in the terminal:
```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 4. Start the Application
Run both the frontend and backend with one simple command from the root directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```

*   🌐 **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
*   ⚙️ **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8000`

## 🔮 Future Scope
* **IoT Sensor Integration:** Real-time data from automatic doors and elevators to update the digital twin instantly.
* **AR Navigation:** Augmented Reality directions overlaid on the smartphone camera for visually impaired users.
